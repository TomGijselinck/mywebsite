			<hr>
			<p>
				Hello! My name is Tom Gijselinck and I'm studying Computer Science and Electrical
				Engineering at the KU Leuven (Belgium). My main interests are computer security,
				cryptography, algorithm design, UNIX/Linux, numerical analysis and web programming.
				<br><br>
				I also participate in athletics at competition level running 800m and 1500m. One day
				I hope getting a medal at the national championships. My current goals are breaking
				the club records on the 800m and 1500m.<p>
			<h3>About this site</h3>
			<p>
				I consider my blog as a sort of notebook and laboratory for trying new things.
				It helps reminding me the solutions to interesting problems I encounter.
				I'll also try to use it as a portfolio of my personal and academic projects and
				accomplishments.
